BUGS

* && and ; symbols are recognized in exactly the same way
* || has not been implemented
* Does not use 'exit()' to exit from function
* # symbol has not been implemented
* Has an upper limit of 50 commands
* Each token has an upper limit size of 100 characters
* Uses 3d(?) array as a container, causes readability and efficiency issues
